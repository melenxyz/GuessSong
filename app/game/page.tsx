 * The `share` surface's denominator, which it went without until now.
 *
 * Every other surface is a DOM node, so `components/loop-cta.tsx` and
 * `components/loop-qr.tsx` can report an impression when it renders. This one
 * is a QR painted into a canvas by `drawCardFooter`, so nothing ever fired and
 * `npm run stats` printed `shown=0` against a non-zero `followed` — a rate of
 * `—` for the one arm that reaches people who have never seen a page of ours.
 * `lib/analytics.ts` is explicit that a funnel without a denominator cannot be
 * read; this is that rule applied to the loop's weakest and least visible arm.
 *
 * **Only the outcomes that leave an artifact count.** `dismissed` means the
 * share sheet was opened and backed out of and `failed` means there was never
 * a blob — in both cases no image exists, so no QR entered the world and an
 * impression would be a denominator for a card nobody has. `downloaded` counts
 * alongside `shared` even though `lib/result-image.ts` notes that only the
 * latter can spread on its own: a file in the camera roll still gets forwarded
 * later, and over-counting the denominator understates the rate, which is the
 * safe direction (same reasoning as `lib/loop-client.ts`'s storage fallback).
 *
 * The unit is therefore **a party that produced at least one card**, not a
 * card: `reportLoopImpression` dedupes per tab session, so saving both the
 * scores card and the taste card counts once. That matches how `game_over` is
 * counted and keeps the two QR arms comparable to each other.
